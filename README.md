The FSM will evaluate the validity of a Morse code sequence and, if valid, decode it into letters and numbers. This design assumes that Morse code sequences follow specific patterns for letters and numbers, with single spaces separating letters, three spaces separating words, and only . (dot) and - (dash) characters as valid Morse symbols. The FSM will ensure that the input is valid based on these rules before decoding it.
